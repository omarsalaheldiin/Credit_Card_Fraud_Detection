# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. The dataset used contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.



## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to identify fraudulent transactions from a highly imbalanced dataset. We explore various machine learning algorithms, including RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, and XGBoost, to achieve high accuracy in fraud detection. We are focusing on ensemble methods because they are the best in dealing with unbalance. 


## Installation
To run this project, you need Python 3.x and the following packages:
- pandas
- NumPy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
